          Valorant is a free-to-play first-person tactical hero shooter
          developed and published by Riot Games, for Windows. Teased under the
          codename Project A in October 2019, the game began a closed beta
          period with limited access on April 7, 2020, followed by a release on
          June 2, 2020. The development of the game started in 2014. Valorant
          takes inspiration from the Counter-Strike series, borrowing several
          mechanics such as the buy menu, spray patterns, and inaccuracy while
          moving.

          Valorant is a team-based first-person tactical hero shooter set in the
          near future. Players play as one of a set of Agents, characters based
          on several countries and cultures around the world. In the main game
          mode, players are assigned to either the attacking or defending team
          with each team having five players on it. Agents have unique
          abilities, each requiring charges, as well as a unique ultimate
          ability that requires charging through kills, deaths, orbs, or
          objectives. Every player starts each round with a "classic" pistol and
          one or more "signature ability" charges. Other weapons and ability
          charges can be purchased using an in-game economic system that awards
          money based on the outcome of the previous round, any kills the player
          is responsible for, and any objectives completed. The game has an
          assortment of weapons including secondary guns like sidearms and
          primary guns like submachine guns, shotguns, machine guns, assault
          rifles, and sniper rifles. There are automatic and semi-automatic
          weapons that each have a unique shooting pattern that has to be
          controlled by the player to be able to shoot accurately. The player
          will get 5 unlocked agents when they create their account, and will
          have to unlock the rest of the agents by collecting an in-game
          currency called Kingdom Credits. Kingdom Credits can be acquired by
          playing games or completing daily and weekly tasks, and can be spent
          on unlocking new agents or cosmetic items. However, within the first
          28 days of release, new Agents can only be unlocked with Valorant
          Points (VP), Agent Recruitment Events, or by having a linked and
          active Xbox Game Pass subscription. VP is an in-game currency that can
          only obtained by purchasing it with real money and it can be spent on
          cosmetic items or new agents.

          More than guns and bullets, youâ€™ll choose an Agent armed with
          adaptive, swift, and lethal abilities that create opportunities to let
          your gunplay shine. No two Agents play alike, just as no two highlight
          reels will look the same. There are a large variety of playable agents
          available in the game. Agents are divided into 4 roles: Duelists,
          Sentinels, Initiators, and Controllers. Each agent has a different
          role which indicates how the agent is usually played.
